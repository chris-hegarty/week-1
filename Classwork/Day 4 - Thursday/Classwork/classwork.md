# Classwork

We will be utilizing the `layoutPractice.jpg` file as a starting point to create a site. This image could be used as a complete road map or it could be used as a starting point. If you're still needing to build your personal site, it might be worthwhile to utilize this time to and this starting point to do that. Your site should have the following:

- The links across the top should be clear that they are clickable (think color change or some effect when hovered over)
- While it is just a single page at the moment, whichever page you're on should have it's link be a different color to show that is the page you are on.
- Think about how you might style the menu differently on the left depending on your need
- An image in the footer is not necessary but if you do not use one, think about how you would get the text to appear above the image.
