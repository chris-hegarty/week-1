## Simple About Page

Using this picture as a potential guide: 

![about.jpg](./about.jpg)

Create a simple web page with all the requisite styling. This page will act as a pseudo about page for you. Fill it in with any information you might want to (can be real or fake) and make it your own. Not shown in the image, the following style should also be applied:
* On hover, the links should change to an orange color.
* Visited links should be red.
* When the image is hovered over, the rounded edges should disappear.

After the above is done, change the colors so that they match better. Also, utilize rgb() color schemes for all colors, and change the fonts to be:
* The top heading and sub-heading should be one font
* the lists should be a second font
* The footer should be a third font.
* at least one font should come from google fonts via a `<link>` tag

You can add a lot more information if you prefer but this should be the bare minimum. Add this to the existing repository you made yesterday as a new page. We will be adding more on as the week progresses but after this you should have two pages.
